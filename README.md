# Image-Inpainting
Course Project for Digital Image Processing (Monsoon 2017)

Implemented Image Inpainting Algorithms:
1) Gaussian Average with Diffusion Barriers as specified in the paper "Fast Digital Image Inpainting" by M. Oliveira (https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~richard/docs/inpainting.pdf)
2) Partial Differential Equations model
3) Median Diffusion
